Fikran: A Dual-Pyramid Neural Architecture for Distributed Cognitive and Adaptive Intelligence

Abstract

This paper introduces Fikran, a novel neural architecture inspired by a dual-pyramid geometric configuration, converging at a unified base. The system integrates seven distributed neural cells positioned across six spatial axes and a central core. Each cell incorporates power modules, remote sensing, cognitive communication, and adaptive learning units. Additionally, pre-decision and post-decision inference stations are embedded to enhance decision-making accuracy and environmental responsiveness. Fikran proposes a scalable, intelligent neural framework suitable for next-generation adaptive systems in complex environments.

1. Introduction

Artificial neural networks have become a foundational component in modern machine learning applications. However, traditional models often lack spatial awareness, distributed intelligence, and adaptive environmental integration. To address these limitations, we propose Fikran, a dual-pyramid neural framework designed with physical geometry and intelligent node distribution.

The architecture is inspired by spatial harmony, with neural nodes organized across right, left, top, bottom, front, back, and center axes. This spatial configuration mimics organic intelligence in dynamic 3D environments. The goal is to create an adaptable, modular system capable of learning, sensing, and making decisions collaboratively across its structure.

2. Architecture Overview

Fikran is composed of two inverted pyramids that meet at a central base. At each tip and face of the pyramids, intelligent neural cells are placed to perform the following:

Process local sensory input

Communicate with neighboring nodes

Adapt based on environmental feedback


Each of the 7 cells includes:

Neural Core: Processes local data and applies learning algorithms

Power Unit: Supplies energy independently or through shared flow

Sensors: Detect changes in local environment

Remote Sensing & Communication: Allows long-distance perception and inter-node cognition

Cognitive-Adaptive Engine: Updates behavior based on experience


3. Inference Pipeline

To enhance the decision-making process, we introduce two new layers:

Pre-decision Inference Station: Performs scenario simulation and early filtering before action

Post-decision Evaluation Station: Validates outcomes and updates models accordingly


These components allow the network to emulate conscious-like assessment before and after decision points.

4. Implementation & Simulation

The initial prototype is implemented in PyTorch and deployed on a modular framework. Experiments show the advantage of spatially distributed cognition when tested in environments with shifting rules and dynamic agents.

5. Applications

Fikranâ€™s architecture is suitable for:

Autonomous robotics with full-environment awareness

Distributed sensing systems in smart cities

Cognitive edge devices for adaptive IoT

Simulation of artificial general intelligence modules


6. Future Work

We plan to:

Extend the network to N-dimensional spatial configurations

Add thermal regulation units (cooling stations)

Optimize power-sharing algorithms

Deploy in real hardware prototypes


7. Conclusion

Fikran represents a step toward embodied, spatially intelligent neural systems. By combining geometry, distribution, and cognitive adaptability, it paves the way for systems that learn, think, and respond like living organisms in dynamic worlds.
